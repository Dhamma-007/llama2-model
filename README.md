In this project, a Streamlit-based web application has been developed to facilitate the automatic generation of blog content using the LLama 2 language model. The application prompts users to input a blog topic, specify the desired word count, and select a target audience or style (e.g., Researchers, Data Scientists, or Common People).

The LLama 2 language model, implemented through the CTransformers library, is employed to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses based on the provided inputs. The application utilizes a predefined prompt template that incorporates user-specified variables such as blog style, topic, and word count.

The user interface is designed with Streamlit, allowing users to seamlessly input their preferences and trigger the generation of blog content with a single button click. The LLama 2 model responds to the prompt, and the generated content is displayed to the user.

This project aims to streamline the process of creating blog content, especially for specific job profiles or audience types, by leveraging advanced language models. The LLama 2 model's ability to understand and generate human-like text contributes to the effectiveness of the automatic blog generation process.
